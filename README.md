# Aviation_Accidents
## Background 
In this Project we are using the data gathered from a combination of 2 sources ( Kaggle - which had information on crashes from 1908 t0 2008) and used Webscraping to get the Accident information from 2009-2019. Webscrpaing the site   www.planecrashinfo.com to get the accident information on recent crashes  We have also used worldbankdata- For total flight departures data to see how the Aviation security and safetly has been stablising over the years. It is particularly interesting to observe the trend of airplane crashes and the reasons behind them, as air travel is the one of the most common transport medium these days. 

## Approach: 

 After data collection , Cleaning and transformation of the data was done using python Panda.
 
## Analysis and visualisation

   With the data gathered , we now set out to find , whats the most leading cause for accidents, For this we did a text serch in the summary field of accident information to classify the cause for accidents, Distribution of Accident Causes, accidents by aircraft type
 Trends in aircraft Accidents and also Map and plot the aircrash sites.
 
## Visualisations using plotly.js , leaflet.js

Use Web scraping and datasets from 1908 till date to collect aviation accident details, and visualize the crash sites using Leaflet.js and determine the leading cause for accidents 
Technologies Used:  Flask, Leaflet.js, JavaScript, SQLite, Pandas, HTML, CSS
